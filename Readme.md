This Project uses a low-cost methodology to convert a traditional AC to a smart AC.


Basic logic:
If human body detection module sense empty room, it return 0 reading to the port.
The program start to do the counting towards 10min / any time that you want, it could be customized.

How my device connect to the AC:
Use the infra RED receptor, connected to the port, and use the controller you have (I did for Gree and Mitsubishi) to take in the array sended by the controllers.
Then store the arrays into database. Send them when the logic designed is met.

Sample signal for Gree:

No need to mention, this is a huge array.

At first i store them in the main memory of arduino uno, but they are really too big. So i use const int to store them to flash memory, which is enough for more than 50 lines for Gree. But some good companies in AC developer more complex infrared red signal, taking more space in my memory. Maybe could use Wifi module to store them in the online databse such as Mongodb, so that the device can pull those data when necessary. Plus, connecting to the wifi allows remote start, set timer, and more advanced features. Which is a to-do for this project.
